# POST /io/board/access
Bulk update board members and roles.

Warning: this endpoint can be destructive to user assignments and user subscriptions. If you reduce a user's role to `boardReader` they will be unassigned from cards on the targeted boards. If you remove a user's access to a board they will be both unassigned and lose any of their subscriptions to changes on cards, lanes, and boards.
